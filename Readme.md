# Face-Detection-and-Classification
I have made face detection algorithm using opencv and I used LBP face detector. I imported LBP face detector using cascadeclassifier() of 
opencv library and then imposed a condition to detect only one face. Then I took a two different class of images each having 12 images and
then trained the classifier.
